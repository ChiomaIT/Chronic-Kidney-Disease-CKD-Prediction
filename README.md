# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-CKD-Prediction

* The aim of this project is to diagnostically predict the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in patients. The goal is to identify individuals with a risk of having CKD by analyzing their medical information using machine learning techniques.
___

* To answer this question, I plan to use the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset (from Kaggle), which contains data from hundreds of patients. The CKD dataset comprises of about 400 instances with 24 features, including both numerical and categorial variable types. Some features have missing values, and preprocessing will be necessary to handle these gaps effectively. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of CKD.
___

* I chose this topic because about 35 million people in the US are estimated to have CKD and about 90% of these people do not know that they have it. The lack of early detection and affordable treatment options worsens the situation, leading to severe cases. By employing machine learning techniques to predict CKD from medical data, this project aims to contribute to early diagnosis and timely intervention, potentially saving lives and reducing the healthcare costs associated with the late treatment of kidney disease.
